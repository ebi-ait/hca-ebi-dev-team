# Updating Metadata through Spreadsheets
Note that getting the spreadsheet via the mechanism below will only work for the very first update you do. For all subsequent updates you need to keep hold of the updated spreadsheet you submit and change that again. This is a temporary measure.

1) Select the submission on which the updates will be based. This can be achieved in either of the following ways:
   * The user has the readily available link to the submission (through the tracker, etc.)
   * Search using the projects UI (`/projects/list`).
     1) In the search bar, enter a keyword, then press enter.
     2) Select any of the search results by clicking on the link under the `Project UUID` column.
     3) In the project view, a list of submissions containing the given project is shown; select from this list.
		* Creation timestamps shown in this list may be used to check which of the submissions is the latest.
2) From the submission view, click the `Download spreadsheet` button to download a copy of the uploaded spreadsheet that has been updated with metadata UUIDs.
3) Update the spreadsheet as needed.
4) When the updated spreadsheet is ready, go back to the projects UI and search for the project to be updated.
5) Click on the `Create submission` button.
6) In the upload spreadsheet page, click the `Browse` button and select the updated spreadsheet file to upload.
7) Select `Update` as upload type.
8) Click `Upload` button to start the update process.

Note that only entities that have changed from the previous submission will form a part of the update submission
