# Ingest Dev Team Roles
These are the official roles within the ingest DCP team. This doesn't mean other people can't also do them but the holder is ultimately responsible for making sure that they are performed.

| Role             | Holder         | Responsibilities                                               |
|------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Team lead        | Justin         | Lead the team. Attend tech-arch meetings, management meetings. |
| Scrum master     | Justin         | Run the team's Scrum process.                                  |
| Security lead    | Rodrey, Alexie | Attend devsecops meetings. Bring security matters to the attention of the team. |
| Release engineer | Rotates weekly among the team except for the Team lead | Run the [release management process](https://allspark.dev.data.humancellatlas.org/dcp-ops/docs/wikis/Ingest-Runbook). Triage data operations issues. Triage ingest integration test failures, both DCP-wide and ingest-specific. This is a big role so it will often significantly reduce the other work the release manager can do in that week. |
