# Sprint Planning and Tracking
[Zenhub workspace](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/ingest-dev-5cfe1cb26482e537cf35e8d1)

# Start of the sprint
* Collectively decide which tickets should be in the sprint backlog for this sprint. As a rough guide, aim for a points total that matches the moving average in the planning spreadsheet.

# During the sprint
* When you start working on a ticket, assign yourself as the owner and move it to the In Progress column.
* When a ticket is done, either move it to Done or Review/QA if it needs code review or checking by another dev team member.
* If you need to do work during a sprint that isn't on the board and it takes longer than about an hour, please add as a task with the label `emerged` and t-shirt small, medium or large labels, depending on how long you think it will take.
  * `t-shirt small` <= 1/2 a day
  * `t-shirt medium` <= 1 day
  * `t-shirt large` > 1 day

# Before the end of sprint
* As the sprint end nears, look at all tickets in Review/QA and move them to Done wherever possible. The scrum master and the ticket owner are responsible for this. Actions include prioritizing code reviews or getting the person who created the ticket to confirm they are happy with the result.
* Just before the end of the sprint, meet to identify tickets that will probably be required next sprint (as per the [standing list of feature priorities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bYrRUz5TCENrWxOlhVsULJZiyIyQIUAbT6qwPBuUG10/edit) and conversation with the product owner), and do points estimates for these.

# End of the sprint
* Any tickets in Review/QA must be moved to done.
* Count points done and tally in [the planning spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L5oRSWaKiPDWFgaHy-3r5IBpEOGZo0KZkdbaYgTpIAA/edit#gid=1661053301).
* Move all done tickets to closed.

# Notes
* We do not use the Merged column.
