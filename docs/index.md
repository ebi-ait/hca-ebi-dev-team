# DCP Ingest Wiki

This wiki compiles guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for maintaining and operating the DCP Ingest platform. SOPs that are in other documentation (e.g. Google Docs) will be migrated here over time. Links to the Google docs are in [the Google master document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sMxKPh1d_RwTwCSSX-8PzcBeQWeynwcUrXKUOyIV3xc/edit?pli=1#heading=h.gtjks9d07wll).
